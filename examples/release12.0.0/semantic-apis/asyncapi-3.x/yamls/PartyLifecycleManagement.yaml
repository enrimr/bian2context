    BIAN Service Domain (expanded with the BIAN BOM) | This service domain
    tracks the state of a party relationship with the bank from the initial
    checks made during the establishment of a new party connection and
    subsequently maintained as necessary over the duration of the relationship.
    The checks and the maintenance requirements will vary by party type and
    jurisdiction. The checks cover bank specific and legal and regulatory
    considerations and may be updated based on a standard schedule or by request
    in specific circumstances.

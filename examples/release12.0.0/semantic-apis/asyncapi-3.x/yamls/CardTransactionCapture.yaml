            A particular point in the progression of time defined by a mandatory
            date and a mandatory time component, expressed in either UTC time
            format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ), local time with UTC offset format

            Note on the time format:

            1) beginning / end of calendar day

            00:00:00  -  the beginning of a calendar day

            24:00:00  -  the end of a calendar day

            2) fractions of second in time format

            Decimal fractions of seconds may be included. In this case, the
            involved parties shall agree on the maximum number of digits that
            are allowed.

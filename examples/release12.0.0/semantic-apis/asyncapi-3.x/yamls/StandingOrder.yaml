  description: >-
    BIAN Service Domain (expanded with the BIAN BOM) | Customers can issue
    standing orders to the bank. In most cases this is for the execution of a
    periodical payment, but there are other standing instructions like, sweeping
    balances at end of month, topping off excess funds for a current account,
    etc.

            Guy's Definition: I see a financial facility as any type of ongoing
            arrangement so a current account, credit card or even a loan account
            are all financial facilities in that they persist over multiple
            possible transactions. Basically I think most banking products fall
            into two main categories either: a financial transaction like a
            payment, a trade; or a financial facility.

            A measuring state on which movements in value or amounts of assets,
            rights and obligations are registered.


            Comment: 

            It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of
            something by registering the movements in plus and min when events
            happen which have an impact on the position.

            The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or
            bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a
            business concept. An account will typically group the debit and
            credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from
            transactions,

            Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid
            used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be
            the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be
            any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.

            A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This
            means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer
            pays 100 € in cash, there is

            a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the
            customer position is decreased)

            an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash
            position is increased)


            An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a
            group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for
            multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can
            perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in
            real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital,
            accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This
            practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in
            digital accounting, it is common practice.


            Examples:- 

            stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial
            accounting account, customer account, supplier account, ...

            Bank Account BE12 1234 5678 9012: is an individual banking account

            Accounts Payable, is a collective account keeping the balance of the
            amounts to pay by the organisation to its suppliers. The balance is
            the result of the financial movements related to suppliers. This
            account is managed usually in a General Ledger 

            Supplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance of
            the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual supplier.
            The balance is the result of the financial movements related to an
            individual supplier. This account is managed usually in a
            sub-ledger.

            Stock Account x, is an individual account keeping the balance of the
            amounts in stock of a specific good.

    BIAN Service Domain (expanded with the BIAN BOM) | This service domain
    handles/structures the customer narrative during an interactive session. It
    consolidates and presents pertinent customer information and provides
    servicing guidelines with standard dialogue/scripting as appropriate. It can
    include the capability to provoke questions to capture key relationship and
    sales triggers. It also ensures the correct sequencing, dialogue content and
    actions are performed/initiated during the customer interaction. It may
    further leverage the session by passing on customer notifications, status
    updates and triggering sales/marketing efforts.

    BIAN Service Domain (expanded with ISO200022) | Packaged Business Capability
    (PBC) | DDD Bounded Context | This service domain tracks the state of a
    party relationship with the bank from the initial checks made during the
    establishment of a new party connection and subsequently maintained as
    necessary over the duration of the relationship. The checks and the
    maintenance requirements will vary by party type and jurisdiction. The
    checks cover bank specific and legal and regulatory considerations and may
    be updated based on a standard schedule or by request in specific
    circumstances.

            Bank Guarantee vs Letter of Credit 


            A bank guarantee is a promise from a lending institution that
            ensures the bank will step up if a debtor can't cover a debt.


            Letters of credit are also financial promises on behalf of one party
            in a transaction and are especially significant in international
            trade.


            Letter of credit is an financial document for assured payments, i.e.
            an undertaking of the buyer's bank to make payment to seller,
            against the documents stated. A bank guarantee is a guarantee given
            by the bank to the beneficiary on behalf of the applicant, to effect
            payment, if the applicant defaults in payment.
